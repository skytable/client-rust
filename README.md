## Introduction

This library is the official client for the free and open-source NoSQL database
[Skytable](https://github.com/skytable/skytable). First, go ahead and install Skytable by
following the instructions [here](https://docs.skytable.io/getting-started). This library supports
all Skytable versions that work with the [Skyhash 1.1 Protocol](https://docs.skytable.io/protocol/skyhash).
This version of the library was tested with the latest Skytable release
(release [0.7.5](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/releases/v0.7.5)).

## Features

- Sync API
- Async API
- TLS in both sync/async APIs
- Connection pooling for sync/async
- Use both sync/async APIs at the same time
- Always up-to-date

## Using this library

This library only ships with the bare minimum that is required for interacting with Skytable. Once you have
Skytable installed and running, you're ready to follow this guide!

We'll start by creating a new binary application and then running actions. Create a new binary application
by running:

```shell
cargo new skyapp
```

**Tip**: You can see a full list of the available actions [here](https://docs.skytable.io/actions-overview).

First add this to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
skytable = "0.7.0-alpha.4"
```

Now open up your `src/main.rs` file and establish a connection to the server while also adding some
imports:

```rust
use skytable::{Connection, Query, Element, SkyResult};
fn main() -> SkyResult<()> {
    let mut con = Connection::new("127.0.0.1", 2003)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

Now let's run a `Query`! Change the previous code block to:

```rust
use skytable::{error, Connection, Query, Element};
fn main() -> Result<(), error::Error> {
    let mut con = Connection::new("127.0.0.1", 2003)?;
    let query = Query::from("heya");
    let res: String = con.run_query(&query)?;
    assert_eq!(res, "HEY!");
    Ok(())
}
```

## Running actions

As noted [below](#binary-data), the default table is a key/value table with a binary key
type and a binary value type. Let's go ahead and run some actions (we're assuming you're
using the sync API; for async, simply change the import to `use skytable::actions::AsyncActions`).

### `SET`ting a key

```rust
use skytable::actions::Actions;
use skytable::sync::Connection;

let mut con = Connection::new("127.0.0.1", 2003).unwrap();
con.set("hello", "world").unwrap();
```

This will set the value of the key `hello` to `world` in the `default:default` entity.

### `GET`ting a key

```rust
use skytable::actions::Actions;
use skytable::sync::Connection;

let mut con = Connection::new("127.0.0.1", 2003).unwrap();
let x: String = con.get("hello").unwrap();
assert_eq!(x, "world");
```

Way to go &mdash; you're all set! Now go ahead and run more advanced queries!

## Binary data

The `default:default` keyspace has the following declaration:

```text
Keymap { data:(binstr,binstr), volatile:false }
```

This means that the default keyspace is ready to store binary data. Let's say
you wanted to `SET` the value of a key called `bindata` to some binary data stored
in a `Vec<u8>`. You can achieve this with the `RawString` type:

```rust
use skytable::actions::Actions;
use skytable::sync::Connection;
use skytable::types::RawString;

let mut con = Connection::new("127.0.0.1", 2003).unwrap();
let mybinarydata = RawString::from(vec![1, 2, 3, 4]);
assert!(con.set("bindata", mybinarydata).unwrap());
```

## Going advanced

Now that you know how you can run basic queries, check out the [`actions`] module documentation for learning
to use actions and the [`types`] module documentation for implementing your own Skyhash serializable
types. Need to meddle with DDL queries like creating and dropping tables? Check out the [`ddl`] module.
You can also find some [examples here](https://github.com/skytable/client-rust/tree/v0.7.0-alpha.4/examples)

## Connection pooling

This library supports using sync/async connection pools. See the [`pool`] module-level documentation for examples
and information.

## Async API

If you need to use an `async` API, just change your import to:

```toml
skytable = { version = "0.7.0-alpha.4", features=["aio"], default-features = false }
```

You can now establish a connection by using `skytable::AsyncConnection::new()`, adding `.await`s wherever
necessary. Do note that you'll the [Tokio runtime](https://tokio.rs).

## Using both `sync` and `async` APIs

With this client driver, it is possible to use both sync and `async` APIs **at the same time**. To do
this, simply change your import to:

```toml
skytable = { version="0.7.0-alpha.4", features=["sync", "aio"] }
```

## TLS

If you need to use TLS features, this crate will let you do so with OpenSSL.

### Using TLS with sync interfaces

```toml
skytable = { version="0.7.0-alpha.4", features=["sync","ssl"] }
```

You can now use the async `sync::TlsConnection` object.

### Using TLS with async interfaces

```toml
skytable = { version="0.7.0-alpha.4", features=["aio","aio-ssl"], default-features=false }
```

You can now use the async `aio::TlsConnection` object.

### _Packed TLS_ setup

If you want to pack OpenSSL with your crate, then for sync add `sslv` instead of `ssl` or
add `aio-sslv` instead of `aio-ssl` for async. Adding this will statically link OpenSSL
to your crate. Do note that you'll need a C compiler, GNU Make and Perl to compile OpenSSL
and statically link against it.

## MSRV

The MSRV for this crate is Rust 1.39. Need const generics? Add the `const-gen` feature to your
dependency!
